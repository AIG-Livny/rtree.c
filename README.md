## Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include "rtree.h"

struct city {
    char *name;
    double lat;
    double lon;
};

struct city phx = { .name = "Phoenix", .lat = 33.448, .lon = -112.073 };
struct city enn = { .name = "Ennis", .lat = 52.843, .lon = -8.986 };
struct city pra = { .name = "Prague", .lat = 50.088, .lon = 14.420 };
struct city tai = { .name = "Taipei", .lat = 25.033, .lon = 121.565 };
struct city her = { .name = "Hermosillo", .lat = 29.102, .lon = -110.977 };
struct city him = { .name = "Himeji", .lat = 34.816, .lon = 134.700 };

bool city_iter(const double *min, const double *max, const void *item, void *udata) {
    const struct city *city = item;
    printf("%s\n", city->name);
    return true;
}

int main() {
    // Create a new rtree where each item is a `struct city*`. 
    struct rtree *tr = rtree_new();

    // Load some cities into the rtree. Each insert operation performs a copy
    // of the data that is pointed to in the second and third arguments. 
    // The R-tree expects a rectangle, which is two arrays of doubles. 
    // The first N values as the minimum corner of the rect, and the next
    // N values as the maximum corner of the rect, where N is the number of
    // dimensions. The default R-tree has 2 dimensions.
    // When inserting points, the max coordinates are optional.
    rtree_insert(tr, (double[2]){phx.lon, phx.lat}, NULL, &phx);
    rtree_insert(tr, (double[2]){enn.lon, enn.lat}, NULL, &enn);
    rtree_insert(tr, (double[2]){pra.lon, pra.lat}, NULL, &pra);
    rtree_insert(tr, (double[2]){tai.lon, tai.lat}, NULL, &tai);
    rtree_insert(tr, (double[2]){her.lon, her.lat}, NULL, &her);
    rtree_insert(tr, (double[2]){him.lon, him.lat}, NULL, &him);
    
    printf("\n-- Northwestern cities --\n");
    rtree_search(tr, (double[2]){-180, 0}, (double[2]){0, 90}, city_iter, NULL);

    printf("\n-- Northeastern cities --\n");
    rtree_search(tr, (double[2]){0, 0}, (double[2]){180, 90}, city_iter, NULL);

    // Deleting an item is the same inserting
    rtree_delete(tr, (double[2]){phx.lon, phx.lat}, NULL, &phx);

    printf("\n-- Northwestern cities --\n");
    rtree_search(tr, (double[2]){-180, 0}, (double[2]){0, 90}, city_iter, NULL);

    rtree_free(tr);
}
// output:
// -- Northwestern cities --
// Phoenix
// Hermosillo
// Ennis
// 
// -- Northeastern cities --
// Prague
// Taipei
// Himeji
// 
// -- Northwestern cities --
// Hermosillo
// Ennis
```

## Functions

```sh
rtree_new      # allocate a new rtree
rtree_free     # free the rtree
rtree_count    # return number of items in rtree
rtree_insert   # insert an item
rtree_delete   # delete an item
rtree_search   # search the rtree for items with interecting rectangles
rtree_clone    # make an clone of the rtree using a copy-on-write technique
```

## Generic interface

By default this implementation is set to 2 dimensions, using doubles as the
numeric coordinate type, and `void *` as the data type.

The `rtree.c` and `rtree.h` files can be easily customized to change these
settings.

Please find the type parameters at the top of the `rtree.c` file:

```c
#define DATATYPE void * 
#define NUMTYPE double
#define DIMS 2
#define MAX_ENTRIES 64
```

Change these to suit your needs, then modify the `rtree.h` file to match.

## Testing and benchmarks

```sh
$ tests/run.sh         # run tests
$ tests/run.sh bench   # run benchmarks
```

The following benchmarks were run on Ubuntu 20.04 (3.4GHz 16-Core AMD Ryzen 9 5950X) using gcc-12. 
One million random (evenly distributed) points are inserted, searched, deleted, and replaced.

## Algorithms

This implementation is a variant of the original paper:  
[R-TREES. A DYNAMIC INDEX STRUCTURE FOR SPATIAL SEARCHING](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall08/cos597B/papers/rtrees.pdf)

### Inserting

Similar to the original paper. From the root to the leaf, the rects which will incur the least enlargment are chosen. Ties go to rects with the smallest area. 

Added to this implementation: when a rect does not incur any enlargement at all, it's chosen immediately and without further checks on other rects in the same node. Also added is all child rectangles in every node are ordered by their minimum x value. This can dramatically speed up searching for intersecting rectangles on most modern hardware.

### Deleting

A target rect is searched for from root to the leaf, and if found it's deleted. When there are no more child rects in a node, that node is immedately removed from the tree.

### Searching

Same as the original algorithm.

### Splitting

This is a custom algorithm. It attempts to minimize intensive operations such as pre-sorting the children and comparing overlaps & area sizes. The desire is to do simple single axis distance calculations each child only once, with a target 50/50 chance that the child might be moved in-memory.

When a rect has reached it's max number of entries it's largest axis is calculated and the rect is split into two smaller rects, named `left` and `right`.
Each child rects is then evaluated to determine which smaller rect it should be placed into.
Two values, `min-dist` and `max-dist`, are calcuated for each child. 

- `min-dist` is the distance from the parent's minumum value of it's largest axis to the child's minumum value of the parent largest axis.
- `max-dist` is the distance from the parent's maximum value of it's largest axis to the child's maximum value of the parent largest axis.

When the `min-dist` is less than `max-dist` then the child is placed into the `left` rect. 
When the `max-dist` is less than `min-dist` then the child is placed into the `right` rect. 
When the `min-dist` is equal to `max-dist` then the child is placed into an `equal` bucket until all of the children are evaluated.
Each `equal` rect is then one-by-one placed in either `left` or `right`, whichever has less children.

Finally, sort all the rects in the parent node of the split rect by their
minimum x value.
